= 6. Conclusion

This project successfully implemented and evaluated a range of classical machine learning algorithms and an optimized Artificial Neural Network for binary intrusion detection on the NSL-KDD dataset. In Part 5 it was revealed that the Decision Tree is the top-performing model based on the F1-score, closely followed by ANN. The big takeaway from these results is a classic precision-recall dilemma. The models were really good at being precise, which is fantastic for an intrusion detection system, because the system would not give many false alarms. But unfortunately, their recall was only moderate, meaning they were still letting a lot of real attacks go undetected.


For future work, a focus on prioritizing improving the recall should be set. Improving that will make detection system much more balanced and genuinely useful. One option would be maybe using data-level techniques like SMOTE to balance outline subtle class differences, or perhaps better feature engineering. Algorithmic adjustments, like class weighting, are also an option. Beyond that, exploring into more advanced ensemble models, like XGBoost, is also possible. In the end, moving from binary to multi-class classification would be a big step, building a truly comprehensive intrusion detection system similar to those highlighted in the literature.
